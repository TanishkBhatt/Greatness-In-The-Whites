                <div>This match-winning century came against a formidable Australian attack in the high-stakes final of
                    the World Test Championship 2023-25 at the iconic Lord's, London. Markram anchored South Africa's
                    second-innings chase, displaying a blend of aggression and defensive solidity when the pressure was
                    at its peak. His dismissal of the target was a masterclass in final-innings batting, neutralizing
                    Australia's bowlers and systematically chipping away at the required runs. The victory secured the
                    coveted ICC trophy for South Africa after a 27-year drought, cementing this knock as one of the most
                    significant in the nation's cricketing history and a defining moment of Markram’s career.</div>

            <h2>Ben Stokes's Headingley Miracle: 135*(219)</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Ben Stokes pulled off the "Miracle of Headingley" with an unforgettable and audacious 135 not out against
                Australia in the 2019 Ashes, single-handedly securing a historic one-wicket victory and saving the
                series for England.</p>

                <img width="400" height="300" src="Images/benstokes.jpg" alt="">
                <div>Ben Stokes's heroics at Headingley during the 2019 Ashes Series are arguably the greatest
                    fourth-innings chase in Test history. Trailing by 359 and later needing 73 runs for the last wicket,
                    Stokes launched a breathtaking counter-attack alongside Jack Leach. He farmed the strike, smashing
                    11 fours and 8 sixes, taking on the likes of Hazlewood and Cummins. The sheer audacity and control
                    he exhibited under paralyzing pressure was a display of mental fortitude few have ever matched. This
                    innings not only led England to an improbable one-wicket victory but also kept the series alive,
                    transforming an Ashes whitewash certainty into a memorable, competitive battle, and forever
                    cementing the term "Headingley Hero".</div>

            <h2>Kusal Perera's Galle Heist: 153*(200)</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Kusal Perera played a miraculous lone-hand innings of 153 not out against South Africa in Durban, leading
                Sri Lanka to an incredible one-wicket win and a historic Test series conquest in South Africa.</p>
            <div class="image">
                <img width="400" height="300" src="Images/perera.jpg" alt="">
                <div>Facing a monumental target of 304 against a potent South African pace attack, Kusal Perera played a
                    lone hand that redefined the concept of a tail-end partnership. His unbeaten 153 came primarily with
                    the tail, most notably the 78-run, 10th-wicket stand with Vishwa Fernando, who contributed just 6
                    runs. Perera’s dazzling array of strokes and calculative risk-taking stunned the home side. The
                    innings was a masterclass in chase management, with Perera ensuring he had the strike and dominating
                    the scoring. This unbelievable performance led Sri Lanka to a historic one-wicket victory, making
                    them the first Asian team to conquer South Africa in a Test series in their own backyard, a truly
                    monumental achievement</div>

            <hr>
            <p>Cheteshwar Pujara's career-defining marathon knock of 193 in the 2018 Boxing Day Test in Melbourne

                <div>Pujara's marathon knock in the Boxing Day Test of the 2018-19 Border Gavaskar Trophy in Melbourne
                    was the foundation upon which India built their historic series win. His innings was a demonstration
                    of immense patience, unparalleled concentration, and an almost impenetrable defense, neutralizing
                    Australia's bowling attack over two full days. Pujara’s ability to wear down the opposition bowlers
                    allowed the rest of the Indian lineup to play with greater freedom. This knock was instrumental in
                    India setting a massive total, securing an emphatic victory, and ultimately leading India to become
                    the first-ever Asian team to win a Test series in Australia, a feat that demanded resilience and

            <hr>
            <p>Rishabh Pant's fearless and stunning 89 not out in the final Test at the Gabba broke Australia's 32-year

                <div>The final day of the 2020-21 Border Gavaskar Series at the Gabba, Brisbane, saw one of India's most
                    audacious and successful chases. With the series on the line, Rishabh Pant played a fearless,
                    match-winning innings, shattering Australia's 32-year unbeaten streak at their 'fortress.' Against
                    the likes of Lyon, Cummins, and Hazlewood, Pant displayed incredible maturity, combining aggressive
                    strokeplay with sensible defense when required. His unbeaten 89 ensured India reached the target of
                    328 on a deteriorating fifth-day pitch. This high-octane knock was the culmination of a truly
                    remarkable series comeback for a severely injury-hit Indian side, symbolizing a shift in power and
                    cricketing courage.</div>

            <hr>
            <p>Virat Kohli’s lone-wolf masterpiece of 149 runs against England in the 2018 Edgbaston Test was a
                brilliant demonstration of batting dominance that defined his 'King' status, despite the narrow loss.

                    series at Edgbaston is universally celebrated as a masterpiece. On a challenging pitch where every
                    other Indian batsman struggled against the swinging ball, Kohli carried the team on his back,
                    scoring nearly 50% of the team's total in the first innings. His superb defense, calculated
                    aggression, and ability to shepherd the tail were a demonstration of complete batting mastery in
                    difficult conditions, erasing the memory of his previous struggles in England. This innings defined
                    him as a player who could conquer any condition or opponent, earning him the epithet 'King' for his

                    but he launched an incredible counter-attack, putting the Indian bowlers immediately on the back
                    foot. He combined beautifully with Steve Smith, attacking the quicks and spinners alike with a
                    fearless approach that swiftly took the game away from India. Head's rapid scoring rate and
                    aggressive stroke play—including 25 boundaries and a huge six—was instrumental in lifting Australia
                    to a commanding first-innings total of 469, earning him the Player of the Match award and delivering

                    take the team to a respectable total. He displayed phenomenal grit, blocking out the hostile crowd
